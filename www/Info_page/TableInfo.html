    <h5>On the Graph page we have three buttons and three toggles.</h5>
    <h5>Load Test Data</h5>
    <p>Load Test Data allows you to load supplied test data to see how everything works. You can not export this data as it is only for learning.</p>
    <h5>Reset</h5>
    <p>Next there is a rest button which allows you to reset the chart. This will erase stored data but not if you have saved it on the export page. </p>
    <h5>Toggles</h5>
    <p>Touch a toggle and it will remove the corresponding colored line from the graph. Touch it again and it is back. This helps in viewing the data. </p>
    <h5>Start</h5>
    <p>Pressing start will start the geolocation services on your device. You must allow the device to use your location for it to work. For best results be in a clear out door area
        away from tall buildings as this uses satellites in space and needs a clear shot. If nothing happens you may need to change the mode to bike or drive on the sliding menu.</p>
